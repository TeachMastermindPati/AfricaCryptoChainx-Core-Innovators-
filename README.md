1. **Create Workflow File:**
   - Create a new directory in your repository called `.github/workflows`.
   - Create a file named `wallet-transaction.yml`.

2. **Define the Workflow:**
   - Add the following content to the `wallet-transaction.yml` file:

```yaml
name: Wallet Transaction Workflow

on:
  issues:
    types: [opened, edited]
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

jobs:
  filter:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Filter by Keyword
      if: contains(github.event.issue.title, 'AfricaCryptoChainx') || contains(github.event.issue.body, 'AfricaCryptoChainx') || contains(github.event.issue.body, 'CCXT Wallet')
      run: echo "Relevant keyword found in issue"

    - name: Filter by File
      if: ${{ github.event.pull_request }}
      run: |
        FILES=$(git diff --name-only ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.sha }} ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }})
        echo "$FILES" | grep 'transactions/' && echo "Transaction file changed" || echo "No relevant file changes"
```

### Probot Bot Code for Wallet Transactions

1. **Write Your Bot Code:**
   - Create a JavaScript file for your bot, for example, `index.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = (app) => {
  app.on(['issues.opened', 'issues.edited'], async (context) => {
    const issueContent = context.payload.issue.body;
    if (issueContent.includes('AfricaCryptoChainx') || issueContent.includes('CCXT Wallet')) {
      const issueComment = context.issue({ body: 'Keyword related to AfricaCryptoChainx-CCXT wallet transaction found in issue' });
      await context.octokit.issues.createComment(issueComment);
    }
  });

  app.on(['pull_request.opened', 'pull_request.synchronize'], async (context) => {
    const filesChanged = await context.octokit.pulls.listFiles(context.repo({
      pull_number: context.payload.pull_request.number
    }));
    
    if (filesChanged.data.some(file => file.filename.includes('transactions/'))) {
      const prComment = context.issue({ body: 'Relevant transaction file changed in pull request' });
      await context.octokit.issues.createComment(prComment);
    }
  });
};
```

### Using Your Project Information

1. **Update the Workflow File:**
   - Ensure that the keyword filtering includes relevant terms like 'AfricaCryptoChainx' and 'CCXT Wallet'.
   - Replace `'transactions/'` with the specific directory or file path relevant to your wallet transaction files.

2. **Deploy the Probot Bot:**
   - Set up and deploy your Probot bot with the provided `index.js` file to a hosting platform like [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) or [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

We're excited to announce that AfricaCryptoChainx is launching its new pool soon! This innovative pool will allow users to stake their ACCX tokens and earn USDT. We've developed this feature using free tools and our proprietary free bot to ensure accessibility and efficiency for all our users.

**Project Information:**

- **Project Name:** AfricaCryptoChainx
- **Tools Used:** Free tools and free bot

**Example Code Snippets:**

```python
# Example of using a free tool for blockchain transaction
import free_tool

transaction = free_tool.create_transaction(sender="0x123", recipient="0x456", amount=10)
free_tool.sign_and_send(transaction)

# Example of bot interaction
class CryptoBot:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def execute_trade(self, amount, price):
        print(f"Executing trade for {amount} tokens at {price} each.")
